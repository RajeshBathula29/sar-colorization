sar-colorization
This project focuses on colorizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to enhance their interpretability. The model uses a pix2pix architecture to convert grayscale SAR images into colored images by learning from pairs of SAR and optical images.

The model uses a pix2pix architecture, which is a type of Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). The pix2pix model is designed for image-to-image translation tasks, making it suitable for transforming grayscale SAR images into their colored counterparts.
